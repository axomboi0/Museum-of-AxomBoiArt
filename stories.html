I never planned to become a writer. Stories started as a way to pass time, but slowly they became a way to understand myself. Most of what I write comes from real emotions, loneliness, attachment, fear of losing people, and curiosity about life. I don’t try to make things perfect cause It is fun to make stories.

<b>Hikari no Kizuna (光の絆)</b><br><br>
Ryo Nanda feels like their existence doesn’t matter. They struggle with loneliness, fear of failing expectations, and the feeling that they are a burden to everyone around them. Ryo wants to die, but not because life is unbearable — they just don’t see a reason to stay.  

They continue living mostly out of curiosity and because dying feels painful. Ryo talks about their feelings with their cousin and best friend, Yumi, who tries to help by encouraging healthier habits and less self-criticism. Nothing magically fixes Ryo. The feelings remain, but they keep moving forward slowly.  

Near the end of the story, Ryo notices a dead kitten on the road that they had ignored the previous day. Seeing it crushed by cars breaks them completely. Ryo finally cries and realizes that even small lives have meaning. The story ends with the line: “It is a privilege of living to be curious about death.”

<b>Lies We Live</b><br><br>
This story is set in 1990s Italy, surrounded by mafia families, high society, and quiet violence behind expensive suits. The protagonist, Tarhisa Kafka, is strong but emotionally vulnerable. She loves deeply, and that love becomes her biggest weakness.  

Her boyfriend is protective and dominant, with a high-paying job and dangerous connections. He says he loves her, but there are signs that something is wrong. Slowly, Tarhisa starts noticing strange behavior and emotional distance.  

At the same time, there is another man — cold, mysterious, and from a rival gang — who repeatedly saves her in dangerous situations. He hates her boyfriend for reasons that are revealed slowly. The story explores manipulation, emotional control, loyalty, and what happens when someone realizes that the person they trusted most might be lying. It focuses on Tarhisa learning the truth and figuring out who she becomes after everything falls apart.

<b>Untitled (personal story)</b><br><br>
This one doesn’t have a proper title yet. It’s about growing up feeling alone, dealing with bullying, finding comfort in art, and experiencing love for the first time. The main character is an introverted kid who learns to express himself through drawing and music. He struggles with self-worth, makes mistakes, loses someone important, and slowly learns that heartbreak is part of being human.  

The story doesn’t try to teach a lesson. It simply follows someone through sadness, anger, love, and acceptance. It’s about becoming older, realizing you can’t fix everything, and still choosing to keep creating anyway.
