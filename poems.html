<div class="memory">
You are my sun and I’m a moth.<br>
I know we can’t stay together.<br>
Still, I keep drifting toward your warmth,<br>
not because I am cold,<br>
but because your warmth is my whole world.<br>
I want to be with you. I only want you.
</div>

<div class="memory small">
I know I shouldn’t,<br>
but I keep falling for it.<br>
I know it won’t work,<br>
still, your grace is enough to quiet my heartbeat.
</div>

<div class="memory">
Not as beautiful as you, my love.<br>
You are an angel and the devil,<br>
a bliss and a temptation at the same time.
</div>

<span class="accent"></span>

<div class="memory">
I can’t move on from her,<br>
not because I can’t,<br>
it’s because I don’t want to.<br>
She was my whole world,<br>
and I couldn’t protect my world.<br>
All the promises are just words left in the past.
</div>

<div class="memory small">
I lost her.<br>
And some days it feels like I lost myself too.
</div>

<span class="accent"></span>

<div class="memory">
This isn’t poetry for perfection.<br>
This is just me leaving pieces of myself behind.
