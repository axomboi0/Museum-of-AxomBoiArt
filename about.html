<h1>About Me</h1>

<p class="intro about-intro">
My name is Rehan. Online, people know me as AxomBoiArt.<br>
I draw. I write. Sometimes I sing.<br><br>

I don’t create to impress. I create to survive.<br>
This page holds my story not perfect, not dramatic just life.

<section class="about-text">

<p>
Ever since I was a kid, I felt alone in the world, but it never completely broke me. I was an introvert, and there weren’t many kids near where we lived at that time. Even so, I grew into a bright student despite challenges at home and family problems.
</p>

<p>
Around class 4, a boy named Raja started bullying me almost every day. I was a crybaby back then. I cried over small things. People used to tell me to “man up.” Slowly, my whole class began isolating me. I sat on the back bench alone. Nobody wanted to play with me because of the bully. I complained many times, and sometimes classmates tried to help, but I cried so much that eventually they just stopped trying.
</p>

<p>
There was a girl who used to sit beside me. She was kind of strange in her own way tall, and she spoke like a robot.but years of no contact I heard a news, Last year, she killed herself. I never got to talk to her again properly after leaving that school in class 9. I never got the chance to say goodbye.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, that bully changed schools in class 6, and slowly people started paying attention to me again. After I changed schools later on, nobody could bully me anymore.
</p>

<p>
In college, there was another incident where a narcissistic person degraded me badly. I crashed out completely and broke my own phone. That moment stayed with me.
</p>

<p>
Through everything, art became my greatest comfort. I genuinely enjoyed creating. Anime changed my life in a simple way at first I just wanted to draw anime girls, honestly. I made my instagram account to see anime cosplay.But I saw my cousin draw anime characters,That small curiosity turned into something much deeper.
</p>

<p>
My life story isn’t extraordinary, but it had everything: sadness, anger, love, confusion. I had my first relationship.She was an experience that I can't describe in the words, I genuienly love her so much, oh God her eyes the most gorgeous eyes I ever saw, her smile her voice was like a bliss from heaven, so sweet you can get diabetes but eventually, I experienced my first heartbreak. That’s life, I guess.
</p>

<p>
Its not like I didnt enjoyed living, I had a lot of fun, with my friends and my family. I went to many trips with my friends and with my family, specially walking and hanging out with my friends Roink, Dev, Deep, Kalita, Aman, Soheil, Saumitra, Pragyan, many more haha (sorry if I didnt mention your name I dont want to drag too long haha) and even my online friends (special shoutout to Garry, Bastav and Lucky) so many people I got to know and spend time it was wonderful. I don’t regret living it. I loved every experience this world gave me, even the painful ones.
</p>

<p>
This is my testament that I was here in this world, that I lived among you.
</p>

<p>
These artworks and creative works are my legacy. This is what I leave behind. No regrets.
